Student Name: Lionel Ssengooba Musoke
Roll Number: 012240506
Course Name: Programming in Python Lab 

Course Code: BNCS1213





Question:

Create a simple Python program that manages student data in a file. The program should allow the following operations: Add a student: The user should be able to add a new student's information (roll number, name, and grade) to the file students.txt. The data should be appended to the file. Delete a student: The user should be able to delete a student from the file by entering the student's roll number. The program should search for the roll number in the file and remove that student's record. Exit: The program should allow the user to exit the program.
•	Code to accept user input in the variables named, Roll_Number, Course and Name
•	Line Code that will create a file named student.txt so as to store the user input for the variables using ‘append’
•	Code calling out the list indicating all the input that has been assigned by the user
•	Adding the delete function basing on IF the user chooses to delete a record when prompted.
•	Elseif the program Terminates if not prompted or else input the correct response.

•	Program run prompting users to enter details and display the list:
•	Versus Student.txt stored output in program location.
•	Prompting Student to delete the record

•	Confirmation that deleted entry has been removed from the student.txt file and list updated

#creating the file called student.text file creating it in append mode so that new entry will be written at the end. Data entered should save automatically in the student.txt
open('student.txt', 'a')

#student.txt created in the default folder next command is to store the details received  from the variables having the fil. the input will be written.
