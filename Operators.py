#Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic operations +-X/

# + operator Adds two numerals and concatinates or joins sequencies (they can be in form of strings,list,tuple etc)
#a=10
#b=20
#d=bool (True+False)
#c=a+b
#d="MYLAB"+"16.4"
#print(c,sep="/n")
#print (d)

#-operator subttracts two numerals
#a=10-5
#print (a)

# * operator performs two operations multiplying numbers
#calculate the area of a triangle

#Base=float (input("Enter Base in CM:"))
#Height=float (input("Enter Height in CM:"))
#Area=1/2*Base*Height
#print(Area,"CM")

#list1=[0]*10
#print(list1)

#logical Operators used to combine statements or boolean expressions
#THese Logical And Logical Or and Logical Not

#Loical And :Both expressions have to be true for the result to be true else false.
#Example
a,b= 5,6
c=True
print(a>4 and b<10) #Both conditions are true so it will print TRUE as output

#Logical Or :Either of the expressions has to be true  so as for the condition to be true but of both conditions are  false
#then Expression will be false.
#Example
print (a>4 or b<2)
#logical Not : Will give the opposite of the output. if true it will return false and the reverse is true
#Example
print(not c )
